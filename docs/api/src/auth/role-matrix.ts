/**
 * B17: the one source of truth for who can do what in the dashboard. Every
 * role-gated admin route is tagged with an area through `@Area()`, which
 * applies exactly `AREA_ROLES[area]` as its `@Roles()`; `GET admin/roles`
 * returns the same constants, and scripts/lib/check-admin-roles.mjs
 * (run by CI and by Jest) fails on any admin route whose roles don't match
 * its area, so the published matrix and the enforced one can't drift.
 *
 * Routes open to any signed-in staff member (admin/me, admin/auth/*,
 * admin/overview, admin/preview-token, admin/roles) carry no area; they're
 * the checker's explicit allow-list.
